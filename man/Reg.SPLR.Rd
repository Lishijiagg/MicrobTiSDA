\title{Fit Spline Regression Models with Knot Selection}
\usage{
Reg.SPLR(
  Data_for_Reg,
  pre_processed_data,
  z_score = NA,
  unique_values = 5,
  Knots = NULL,
  max_Knots = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data_for_Reg}{The data frame output from the \code{\link[MicrobTiSDA]{Design}}.}

\item{pre_processed_data}{The transformed data output from the \code{\link[MicrobTiSDA]{Data.trans}} function. A
pre-processed OTU data frame with sample IDs as row names and OTU IDs as column names.}

\item{z_score}{A numeric value specifying the z-score threshold for outlier filtering; if \code{NA}, no
outlier filtering is performed (default: \code{NA}).}

\item{unique_values}{An integer specifying the minimum number of unique values required in an OTU for spline fitting (default: 5).}

\item{Knots}{An optional numeric vector specifying the knots to use in the spline regression. If \code{NULL}, the optimal number of
knots is determined by minimizing the GCV criterion (default: \code{NULL}).}

\item{max_Knots}{An integer indicating the maximum number of knots to consider when selecting the optimal spline model (default: 5).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"MicrobTiSDA_spline_regression"} containing:
\item{fitted_model}{A nested list of the fitted spline regression models for each design dummy
variable and OTU.}
\item{knots_info}{Contains the corresponding knots information for each model.}
}
\description{
The \code{Reg.SPLR} function fits natural spline regression models to time-series OTU data for each subgroup
defined by design dummy variables. It uses \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} to model the relationship between OTU
abundance and time, incorporating a z-score based outlier filtering step (optional) and selecting the optimal number
of knots via the Generalized Cross-Validation (GCV) criterion when not provided by the user.
}
\details{
\code{Reg_SPLR} utilize Generalised Additive Model (GAM,see \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}) to fit natural splines. Here, let \eqn{x_{ni}(t)} denote
the transformed abundance of microbial feature \eqn{i} at time point \eqn{t}. To explain the evolution of microbial abundance along the
time (\eqn{t}), the following generalized additive model is considered
\deqn{x_{ni}(t) = \beta_{n0} + \sum_{k=1}^K \beta_{nk} \cdot N_{nk}(t) + \epsilon_{ni}}
where \eqn{\beta_{n0}} is the intercept term, \eqn{\beta_{nk}} denotes the regression coefficients for the k-th natural spline basis function
\eqn{N_{nk}(t)}, and \eqn{\epsilon_{ni}} is the error term. The parameter \eqn{K} refers to the number of basis functions, which is equal to the
number of knots plus one. (i.e., \eqn{K = number of knots + 1}).

If a z-score threshold is specified via \code{z_score}, observations with absolute z-scores exceeding this threshold are removed prior to model
fitting. When the OTU has more unique values than specified by \code{unique_values}, the function searches over a range of knot numbers
(from 1 up to \code{max_Knots}) to select the optimal model based on the GCV criterion; if \code{Knots} is provided, it is used directly
in constructing the natural spline basis. The fitted models and their corresponding knots information are stored in a nested list
structure and returned.

# Assuming Data_for_Reg is obtained from a design step and pre_processed_data contains OTU data:

                  z_score = 2,

                  Knots = NULL,
                  max_Knots = 5)
